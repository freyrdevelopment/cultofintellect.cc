        <bg-text>Let's cut to the chase: we will no longer continue offering Dx9ware. We have shut<br> down the software's services as of this announcement,<br> and all user data has been deleted.<br>As important Dx9ware was for the growth and credence of our company, it became<br> clear that we must expand our horizons and move on<br>. In light of this new direction,<br> we have decided to sunset Dx9ware and begin work on more<br> ambitious projects. We are currently working on many very exciting things,<br> which we hope to showcase soon. For now,<br> you can learn more about our recent undertaking here: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/exploit-prevention-update/2663101<br>We want to thank our users for their support and understanding throughout the years.<br> It really has been a pleasure to serve you all.<br> We are thrilled about what the future holds for us,<br> and we hope that you will continue to follow our journey.<br>Sincerely,<br>The Dx9ware team.</bg-text>
